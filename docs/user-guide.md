The Ultimate chat-app gives you opportunity to use different rooms:
To change or create room choose the “Rooms” option (10.)
If you want to create new room all you need to do is to choose “Add new room” option, name the room and decide if you want to keep the room as public or if you prefer to make it private.
If you choose first option leave “Room Password” field empty, If you would like to chat only with selected people, put the password and share the credential of the Room with them.
Private room gives you an option to invite users to the room. In order to do that:
1. Click “Rooms”(10.)
2. Select “Invite users”
3. Enter the user nickname you would like to invite and room password
4. Keep in mind that the user you selected will get notification with an option to accept or decline your invitation.
Are you bored of the room? You can change it in “Rooms” button. If you click “Choose room” tab you will see the list of available rooms. Some of them has a locker icon next to the name. It means that the room is private and you will need a password to enter it, if there is no locker, after selecting the room you will be redirected directly to the room.
